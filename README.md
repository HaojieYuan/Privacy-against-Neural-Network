# Privacy-against-Neural-Network
 With the development of Neural network, crawler can get much more information than ever. For example a milk powder manufacturer can classify images published in a social network to find users who published photo with baby inside, in order to sale products to them.
 
  To protect our privacy, we apply adversarial examples of neural network to confuse the neural network which tries to classify the images.

  We build up a social network to simulate users publishing images and admin using neural network to classify images. Then we build a adversarial example generator to process  images before user upload to neural network. Experiment result shows the processed image can not be classified correctly any more.
